        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <h3>Why did you do Ironhack?</h3>
        <p>
          UX/UI Design piqued my interest and ticked all my personal boxes, and
          I wanted to find the fastest, most efficient way to learn from
          professionals and make the career switch from television operation to
          UX/UI.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you look for in company culture?</h3>
        <p>
          Motivated and dedicated individuals to learn from and bounce ideas
          off, people who have other interesting hobbies outside of work, and a
          creative and relaxed atmosphere. Eventually I want to get a dog and be
          able to bring him to work with me.
        </p>
        <h3>Superpower and why?</h3>
        <p>
          I remember being asked this question in my very first job interview
          after uni, and my answer then was "Time Manipulation." Five years
          later, my answer would have to be the same. I would have unlimited
          do-overs.
